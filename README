#The main code is in Interpreter.oz, which requires files ProcessRecords.oz, SingleAssignmentStore.oz, Input.oz and Unify.oz to be in the same directory. 

#We have answered the Questions 1-5. 

#We have NOT handled the cases where AST of program is itself wrong, or not according to the specifications. 

#We have run the code in Interactive mode without importing System.Show explicitly. For running through terminal, it needs to be imported for proper compilation. 

#For Taking the Input AST, paste the valid AST in Input.oz file provided in the Directory, and run Interpreter.oz.
